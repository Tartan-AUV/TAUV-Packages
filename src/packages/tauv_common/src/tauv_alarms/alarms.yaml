# Instructions:

# Add your alarms to this file, and assign each a unique index number.
# - Alarm names should be all-caps
# - failure_level: one of:
#     - NO_FAILURE: this is purely informative and does not affect the sub behavior
#     - PREDIVE_FAILURE: this alarm is expected but prevents the start of a mission. Eg, waiting for things to boot.
#     - MISSION_FAILURE: this alarm causes a mission to fail (could be ignored) and is likely a critical issue. May still be cleared
#     - CRITICAL_FAILURE: this alarm will abort the mission and disarm the sub. Generally, they cannot be cleared without resetting the system.
# - default_set: if true,the alarm will be set at startup.
