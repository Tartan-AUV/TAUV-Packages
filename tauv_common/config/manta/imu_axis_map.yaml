# Axis map defines mappings from world axes to imu axes.
# eg: axis_map[i-1] = j means that axis i in the robot frame is axis j in the IMU.
# Frames are x,y,z according to REP 105. (x forward, y left, z up)
# If an axis is reversed, you can negate that entry on the axis map.
# Valid axis_maps contain only integers in [-3,3], except zero and one of each axis.
# 1 = x
# 2 = y
# 3 = z
# -1 = -x
# -2 = -y
# -3 = -z
# IMU MUST be right handed! No support for left-handed IMUs yet.
